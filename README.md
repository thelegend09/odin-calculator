# Calculator project

I'm making this calculator for this [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator#assignment) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) Foundations curriculum.

Along with the features this calculator needs to have, I'd like to add:
- [ ] A dark mode toggle
- [ ] A history of operations
- [ ] Keyboard support
- [ ] Keys highlight on screen when keyboard is used
- [ ] A "copy results" button
